Overview and Origin
Amazon

When was the company incorporated? 1994

Who are the founders of the company? Jeff Bezos

How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos in July 1994. The idea for Amazon came about when Bezos, then a hedge fund executive in New York City, noticed the rapid growth of internet usage and realized the potential for e-commerce. Bezos was inspired by the statistic that internet usage was growing at 2,300% per year, and he saw an opportunity to create an online bookstore that could offer a wider selection of books than any physical store.
Bezos initially named the company "Cadabra" (short for "Abracadabra"), but he later changed it to "Amazon" after the Amazon River. Bezos wanted the name to evoke something "exotic and different" and to reflect the company's ambition to become the largest bookstore in the world.

How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
 Amazon was initially funded by Jeff Bezos himself, who invested his own money to start the company. In 1994, Bezos raised an initial seed funding of $1 million from his family and friends to get Amazon off the ground.
In 1995, Amazon went public, raising $54 million through its initial public offering (IPO). The IPO marked a significant milestone for the company, providing it with additional capital to fuel its growth and expansion plans.

Since then, Amazon has primarily relied on its revenue generated from its operations to fund its growth and investments. The company's consistent profitability and strong cash flow have enabled it to finance its various ventures and initiatives without relying heavily on external funding.

Amazon has also occasionally raised additional capital through debt offerings or secondary stock offerings. However, these instances have been relatively infrequent compared to the company's reliance on its own revenue and cash reserves.
